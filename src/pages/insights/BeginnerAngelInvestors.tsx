          <h2>Introduction</h2>

          <p>Angel investing is changing the world of investing, bringing in people who want to help new businesses. But what exactly is angel investing and why is it important?

With more people interested in starting businesses and creating new things, many people are learning about angel investing to find the next big idea and help create a friendly environment for startups.</p>
