          <h2>SaaS Funding Agreements: Ups and Downs</h2>

          <p>Investors like to put money into SaaS companies due to their recurring revenue business model and high customer lifetime value. This frequent income allows for revenue predictions, scale, and, ultimately, growth.</p>

          <p>But how do SaaS founders access these funds? They need to talk to investors who offer money in exchange for company shares. One key aspect of this relationship is the funding agreements. These typically use preferred shares, which give investors special rights like getting money back first if the company is sold.</p>

          <p>This article looks at the main types of preferred shares in SaaS funding agreements, both from investor and founder viewpoints.</p>

          <h3>Preferred Shares Explained</h3>

          <p>Most venture capital investments in SaaS companies use preferred shares rather than common stock. Preferred shares give special rights, such as:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Liquidation preference (getting back initial investment before others)</li>
            <li>Dividend rights</li>
            <li>Anti-dilution protection</li>
            <li>Board representation</li>
            <li>Voting rights on important company decisions</li>
          </ul>

          <p>These preferences can significantly impact returns for founders and common shareholders in various exit situations.</p>

          <h3>Non-Participating Preferred vs. Participating Preferred Shares</h3>

          <p>When a SaaS company is acquired, how the money is distributed depends on the type of preferred shares. The main choices are:</p>

          <h4>Non-Participating Preferred</h4>

          <p>Investors get either:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Their investment amount back, OR</li>
            <li>They can convert to common shares and share in the exit proceeds proportionally</li>
          </ol>
          <p>They choose whichever gives the higher return.</p>

          <h4>Participating Preferred</h4>

          <p>Investors receive:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Their investment amount back, AND THEN</li>
            <li>They also share in the remaining proceeds as if they had common shares</li>
          </ol>
          <p>This effectively allows "double-dipping" in the exit proceeds.</p>

          <h3>The Impact on Returns: A Simple Example</h3>

          <p>Let's say a SaaS company raised $5 million at a $15 million post-money valuation, giving investors 33.3% ownership. The company later sells for $30 million.</p>

          <h4>Under Non-Participating Preferred:</h4>
          <p>Investors would choose to convert to common shares and receive $10 million (33.3% of $30 million).</p>

          <h4>Under Participating Preferred:</h4>
          <p>Investors would first receive their $5 million back, plus 33.3% of the remaining $25 million ($8.33 million), for a total of $13.33 million.</p>

          <p>This $3.33 million difference comes directly from what founders and employees would receive.</p>

          <h3>Multiple Liquidation Preference: An Additional Complication</h3>

          <p>Some agreements include a multiple liquidation preference, meaning investors receive a multiple of their original investment (e.g., 2x or 3x) before common shareholders get anything.</p>

          <p>For example, with a 2x participating preferred structure and the same scenario above, investors would receive:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>$10 million (2x their $5 million investment) PLUS</li>
            <li>33.3% of the remaining $20 million ($6.66 million)</li>
            <li>Total: $16.66 million</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This leaves common shareholders with only $13.34 million of the $30 million exit.</p>

          <h3>The Founder Perspective</h3>

          <p>For SaaS founders, the preference structure can dramatically impact returns, especially in modest exits. Here's what founders should consider:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Standard 1x Non-Participating Preferred:</strong> Generally most founder-friendly; aligns incentives between investors and founders to maximize company value.</li>
            <li><strong>Participation Feature:</strong> Significantly reduces founder returns in moderate exits; can create misaligned incentives where investors might prefer smaller, safer exits.</li>
            <li><strong>Multiple Preferences:</strong> Can dramatically reduce or eliminate founder returns in all but the highest-value exits.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>The Investor Perspective</h3>

          <p>From the investor viewpoint, preferences provide important downside protection:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Standard 1x Non-Participating Preferred:</strong> Offers basic protection while keeping alignment with founders for big outcomes.</li>
            <li><strong>Participation Feature:</strong> Provides greater downside protection and higher returns across multiple exit scenarios.</li>
            <li><strong>Multiple Preferences:</strong> Provides substantial downside protection and guaranteed return multiple in many exit scenarios.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Industry Trends: What's Market?</h3>

          <p>The prevalence of different preference structures varies based on:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Market Conditions:</strong> In founder-friendly markets, non-participating 1x preferences are standard. In down markets, more investor-friendly terms emerge.</li>
            <li><strong>Investment Stage:</strong> Earlier stages typically have simpler terms.</li>
            <li><strong>Geographic Location:</strong> Silicon Valley tends to have more standardized, founder-friendly terms compared to other regions.</li>
            <li><strong>Investor Type:</strong> Traditional VCs typically stick to standard terms, while strategic investors or less experienced investors might seek more protective provisions.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Negotiation Strategies for Founders</h3>

          <p>For SaaS founders facing these negotiations:</p>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>Focus on the Entire Term Sheet:</strong> While valuation gets headlines, liquidation preferences, participation rights, and multiples can be equally important.</li>
            <li><strong>Consider Multiple Exit Scenarios:</strong> Model how different structures would play out across various exit values.</li>
            <li><strong>Seek Caps on Participation:</strong> If accepting participating preferred, negotiate for caps (typically 2-3x) after which the investor must convert to common.</li>
            <li><strong>Leverage Competition:</strong> When possible, create competitive dynamics among potential investors to negotiate more favorable terms.</li>
            <li><strong>Understand Market Standards:</strong> Know what's "market" for your stage, industry, and location to avoid agreeing to outlier terms.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Conclusion: Balancing Interests</h3>

          <p>The choice between non-participating and participating preferred shares (with or without multiples) represents a fundamental balance between investor protection and founder upside. Neither approach is inherently right or wrong—the key is understanding the implications and negotiating terms that align incentives toward building long-term value.</p>

          <p>In the optimal outcome, both investors and founders align on a capital structure that provides appropriate investor protections while ensuring founders remain highly motivated to build substantial value, resulting in strong returns for all stakeholders.</p>

          <p>For SaaS founders navigating these waters, the goal should be striking this balance—protecting your team's upside while offering investors terms that make your company an attractive investment opportunity.</p>
