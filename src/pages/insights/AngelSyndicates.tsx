          <h2>Introduction</h2>

          <p>In the world of SaaS (Software as a Service), getting money to help your business grow is very important. But where can new startups find the money they need? Angel syndicates can help. They are groups of people who come together to invest in new businesses. Let's learn about what angel syndicates are and why SaaS startups should pay attention to them with help from Collektiv, your friendly guide to investment syndicates.</p>

          <h3>What Are Angel Syndicates?</h3>

          <p>Angel syndicates are groups of individual investors who put their money together to support startups. Unlike big investors who use other people's money, angel syndicate members use their own money. This group approach helps share the risk of investment and brings different ideas to the project.</p>

          <h3>Differences from Traditional VC (Venture Capital) Funding</h3>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>Investment Form:</strong> Venture capitalists (VCs) use other people's money, but angel investors use their own money.</li>
            <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Angel syndicates can provide money faster because there is less paperwork.</li>
            <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Angel syndicates might offer more flexible terms compared to strict VC funding rules.</li>
          </ol>
