          <h2>Welcome!</h2>

          <p>Welcome to the exciting world of Software as a Service, also known as SaaS. Here, change and creativity are super important. At Collektiv, we're exploring important numbers to check when thinking about investing in this fast-growing area. SaaS startups have unique challenges and chances, so it's crucial for investors to focus on important information. We're here to help you understand key performance indicators (KPIs). These are important to make smart decisions when investing in SaaS. With this guide, you can help create positive changes and inclusivity in your investment group.</p>

          <h3>What Are SaaS Metrics?</h3>

          <p>SaaS metrics are numbers that help us understand how well a software startup is doing. They show how healthy the business is, how fast it might grow, and if it can last for a long time. Unlike regular business numbers, SaaS metrics give us a closer look at where the money is coming from, how customers are interacting, and how well the company is running.</p>

          <h3>Why Are Metrics Important?</h3>

          <p>Metrics are a big part of making good investment choices. They give us real facts to see how a company might grow in the future. They show if revenue is consistent, if customers are coming back, and how much things cost. With the right numbers, you can predict how well a company will do and make decisions that match your investment goals.</p>

          <h3>How SaaS Metrics Are Different</h3>

          <p>SaaS metrics are different because they focus on steady money coming in and keeping customers. Traditional businesses might look at holiday sales or one-time buys, but SaaS businesses look at growing steadily through subscriptions. Knowing these specific metrics is key to getting into the SaaS market.</p>

            <li><strong>Why Is Predictable Money Important?</strong> Regular MRR growth means cash flow is steady, which is important for a SaaS company to thrive.</li>
            <li><strong>How to Check MRR Growth?</strong> Look for signs of steady growth every month, but also think about seasonal changes and the market.</li>
