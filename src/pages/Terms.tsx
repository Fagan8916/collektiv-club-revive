              <p>The Customer will indemnify and hold Collektiv harmless from any claim brought by third parties alleging that use of the Collektiv website by the Customer has infringed any applicable local or international legislation or regulation.

              <p>The Customer is forbidden to send e-mail to any person who does not wish to receive it. It is explicitly prohibited to send unsolicited bulk mail messages ("junk mail" or "spam") of any kind (commercial advertising, financial and investment promotions, political tracts, announcements, etc.) or to post the same or similar messages to large numbers of newsgroups (excessive cross-posting or multiple-posting, also known as "USENET spam").

              <p>The Customer acknowledges that Collektiv is unable to exercise control over the content of information passing through its facilities or carried as a result of supplying the Collektiv website and is therefore not responsible for that content.</p>

Nothing in this AUP is to be construed to limit Collektiv's actions or remedies in any way with respect to any of the foregoing activities, and Collektiv reserves the right to take any additional actions it may deem appropriate with respect to such activities, including without limitation, taking action to recover the cost of identifying offenders and terminating their access to the Collektiv website, and charging to cover Collektiv's costs in the event of such termination of access or like situation. Collektiv may co-operate with other service providers to discourage and resist abuses of acceptable use policies.

The Collektiv website may be linked to other networks world-wide and the Customer agrees to conform to the acceptable use policies of these networks. The Customer agrees, through its operations, not to cause disturbances, outages or other problems which may affect Collektiv's or any other network or network based equipment, or which may adversely affect Collektiv's ability to provide access to the Collektiv website.</p>
              
              <p>Nothing contained in this AUP shall be construed to limit Collektiv's actions or remedies in any way with respect to any of the foregoing activities, and Collektiv reserves the right to take any and all additional actions it may deem appropriate with respect to such activities, including without limitation, taking action to recover the costs and expenses of identifying offenders and removing them from the Collektiv website, and levying cancellation charges to cover Collektiv's costs in the event of disconnection of dedicated access for the causes outlined above. In addition, Collektiv reserves at all times all rights and remedies available to it with respect to such activities at law or in equity.</p>
              
              <p>Customer will indemnify and hold Collektiv harmless from any claim brought by third parties relating to the Customer's use of the Collektiv website. The Customer must defend and pay all damages and costs (including legal fees) arising from such claims. The Customer must immediately notify Collektiv of any claim or potential claim, within the Customer's knowledge, involving the Customer related to the Collektiv website. Failure to do so gives Collektiv the right to defend such claims at Customer's sole cost and expense.</p>
              
              <p>Collektiv is committed to providing quality service to all of its Customers. While the AUP may appear harsh, Collektiv believes it is necessary to ensure that it is able to provide professional, efficient, stable service within an environment of security and trust which its Customers may require and come to expect from an organisation such as Collektiv.</p>
